# Prototype of Phred App

Comprehensive web application solution for children between 9-18 years in Borneo working with non-profit Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI) to encourage ASRI children to participate in conservation process by collecting envrionmental data. 

## ðŸ’» Summary

Current environmental data storage system used in Borneo makes input analysis of data difficult and time consuming. Specifically, the Excel sheet used to store data collected from 'PHRED' kits is inefficient, requiring instructors to manually interpret and input qualitative and quantitative data - limiting student engagement and hindering their understanding of Planetary Health's conservatoin process.

Our solution to Dr. Brian Mcadoo and his team has updated the current collection process to facilitate efficient inputting and storage solutions for environmental indicators for soil composition in Borneo forests. Data storage integrates inputting options for results from water minerals, dissolved oxygen levels, pH levels, turbidity and nitrate/nitrite concentration.
